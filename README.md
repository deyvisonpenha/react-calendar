# Front-end Javascript Challenge
This project was developed in React and create a demo calendar application. For that I used only React Hooks and some UI frameworks as Styled-Components and Material-ui. For work with time I used Moment.js

## Structure of Project
App.js have only one component named Calendar that have all other components necessary to layout. I have create two elements as Input and a Color-Selector, these elements can be customized in the future.

## Mandatory Features
I have implemented almost all features as shown below
- [x] Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also,
include a city.
- [x] Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
- [x] Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
- [ ] Ability to edit reminders â€“ including changing text, city, day, time and color.
- [X] Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the
weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
- [X] Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user
entered day and time. Also, include a city.
